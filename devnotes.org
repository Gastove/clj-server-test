* Boy, this is hard.
* Functional CRUD
  What, really, is the difference between:
  1. Creating a new thing with new fields.
  2. Storing an old thing with existing fields?
  Really, it's only a question of where the fields come from -- do they need to be set,
  or do they already exist?

  What ID will a REST request process?

  + *So here's a thing*:
    - I've been calling a model an Atom, but right now they aren't returned as atoms from the DB.
      ...or are they?

* TODO
  - [0/0]
  - [ ] Figure atoms out. Make this consistent
